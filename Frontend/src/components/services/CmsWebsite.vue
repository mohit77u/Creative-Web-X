                            <p>CMS stands for Content Management System, which is essentially software that helps you to build a website. It may provide you with templates, and it will definitely give you a way to create and manage digital content â€” most often through a user-friendly WYSWYG editor which is similar to using Microsoft Word.</p>
                            <p>WordPress is by far the most popular CMS for web development, web hosting and blogging. It is free and easy to use, powered by software that is created by a vast open source community of volunteers who constantly offer new web development solutions. There are so many CMS on which we can develop websites like WordPress, Webflow, Prestashop, Wix, Joomla, Opencart, Squarespace, Drupal, Blogger, etc.</p>
